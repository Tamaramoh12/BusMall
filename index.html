                Our Story:
            </h3>
            <p>
                Startup which introduce products similar similar to the 
                SkyMall catalog found in the seatback pockets on airplanes: 
                a catalog of assorted high-markup products provided to 
                a captive audience seeking a mental escape from the drudgery of travel.  
                The difference with BusMall is that instead of their catalog being placed 
                in airplanes, they are placed on local busses while commuting through traffic.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since catalogs are expensive to print and distribute, and the products cost 
                money to make and warehouse, and BusMall is a lean startup that needs to 
                carefully watch its expenditures, BusMall wants to feature only the items
                 in its catalog that are the most likely to sell.
